- **1b.**

When I compared the sorting algorithms, selection sort was definitely the slowest since it runs in O(n^2) time. Quicksort with a fixed pivot worked fine on random lists but got really slow on already-sorted ones because picking the first element every time caused unbalanced splits. The version of Quicksort that used a random pivot stayed much faster and closer to O(nlogn) on all inputs since it avoided that worst-case behavior. Overall, the randomized Quicksort was more consistent and efficient, while selection sort quickly became too slow as the list size increased.

When I compared my fastest Quicksort, the random pivot one, to Pythonâ€™s built-in sorted function, Timsort was faster every time. On random lists, both followed about O(nlogn) growth, but Timsort still finished quicker. On already-sorted lists, Timsort was way faster because it noticed the list was ordered and basically ran in linear time, while Quicksort still had to do a lot more work. Overall, Timsort ended up being the most efficient and adaptable out of all the methods I tested.
